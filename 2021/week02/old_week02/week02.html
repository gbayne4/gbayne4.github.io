	<h2> Response to <i>Ways of Seeing</i> </h2> 
	<p style= "font-size: 16 px;" style=" font: bold;"
	;> In the first episode in the <i>Ways of Seeing</i>, Berger discusses our perception of the world. How everything has a way of seeing it. His focus was on images and how an image can hold all sorts of information. It also shows how the creator saw the world, even their ideologies though it may not have been their intention. Which is why replicas are not necessarily the exact same as the original. Because the replicator had different ideologies and intentions. This unconsciously affects how we view images. What’s near and around the painting, what we hear, and the context we are given while viewing the painting also effects how we perceive it. I especially enjoyed his statement that "pictures were like words rather than holy relics."

	;> The second part is all about woman, how women were perceived and were made to be perceived. It creates the affect as described by Berger "Men dream of women, women dream of themselves being dreamt of". Women in paintings were made to be looked at, specifically by men which has now had lasting effects. Women were also blamed in hypocritical contexts as shown by paintings (not surprising). Adam and Eve being a prime example, Eve was blamed even though both ate the apple. He also used the example of a painting where a naked lady is holding a mirror and is called vanity. Yet men were the ones we painted her naked for their own pleasure. This reminds me of how men shame women for doing sex work or owning an Only Fans, when they're the ones buying her services. Women in paintings were meant to be constantly available, an object. Berger goes as far as to say being nude is different from being naked. "A nude has to be seen as an object to be nude." Women were not meant to be their own. I was surprised to hear that hair on the body was associated with sexual par and passion, which is why it was minimized in paintings. So, the spectator aka a man feels as though he has a monopoly on the passion of said woman.

	;> The third episode is all about oil paintings and their initial purpose. We often think of oil paintings as prestigious fine art. And while this, in a sense, holds true, as Berger discusses we cannot forget what they were made for. They were for noble rich people to show off. To say this is what I have, be jealous of me. To say, hey, look at my horse, I'm rich. Animals were but mere possessions, holding the same worth as an expensive piece of furniture. Even portraits made people out to be objects, however, objects of respect and envy.

<p style= "font-size: 16px;" style=" font: bold;"

	;> The final episode compares how the old use of oil paintings has been replaced by publicity. They both manifested the idea that you are what you have. But they serve a different purpose. Oil paintings showed off what you had, while publicity is about what you could have. It creates this dream that is only possible if you give into consumerism. It focuses on the idea of what could be rather than what is. People begin to feel undesirable and unenviable if they are not buying what is advertised. The obsession with the future and this dream makes us forget reality, particularly, other realities. Places we should be aware of but can no longer understand. When we read about other parts of the world that may be going through harsher times, and we see the images, yet we cannot relate, therefore, it seems distant and unreal.

<p style= "font-size: 16px;" style=" font: bold;"

	;> My biggest takeaway from Berger's essay was how images truly do hold ideologies. When I first read that statement, I shrugged it off and even thought, there is definitely art that does not have any ideology at all. I was not thinking deep enough. Images are signs of the time they were created. Even the laziest stick figure can give a reference to the creator’s mood. Prominent images such as oil painting and publicity is deeply tied into our society and promotes ideals that would be better if not promoted. I enjoyed the videos (especially the second episode) and am very inspired by Berger’s feminism and values.
