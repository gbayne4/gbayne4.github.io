	<h2> Response to <i>Ways of Seeing</i> </h2> 
	<p style= "font-size: 16 px;" style=" font: bold;"
	;> The first half of Berger's essay discusses our perception of the world. How everything has a way of seeing it. His main focus was on images and how an image can hold all sorts of information. It shows how the creator saw the world, even their ideologies though it may not have been their intention. Which is why replicas are not necessarily the exact same as the orginal. Because the replicator had different ideoligies and intentions. This unconsiously affects how we view images. In some sense I agree, pictures hold the values of the creator. But I also believe some work can be created without value.

	;> The second part is all photos and all the photos have the similar subject of women. He does not explain his reasoning for doing so until the third part of the essay. Here he speaks on how women and men are represented differently in both the images and society. He describes how man typically are shown acting out tasks, meanwhile women "appear". Can't lie, at first I was thrown off by this statement, until he pointed out how this type of image making is hypocritical. It denies women agency, and keeps the traditional idea of women being portrayed as "beauty tools". Images can greatly depict some of the worst aspects in society. Some of which we might not necessarily be trying to show. Just as Berger said in his first part of the essay, images display idealogies we are not consiously aware of.
