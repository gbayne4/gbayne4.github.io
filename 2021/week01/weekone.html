<h2> Response to <i>Long Live the Web</i> </h2> </div>

	;> <i>Long Live the Web</i> overviews the threats to the Web as we know it, many of which are already damaging. I was very interested in the section regarding universality, and was happy when Berners-Lee mentioned the issue of access to the Web for people with disabilities. I had taken a course on technology and disabilities, and through the class, I found out it costed thousands more for someone who is blind to operate a computer in comparison to someone who is not, which is obviously not inclusive. I also was surprised when I learned that having an address other than “http:” meant creating a “closed world” as described. I always found it cool when I saw a website had its own address, not realizing this was closing the site off from the Web, which as a result, slows innovation. Another thing I learned (which I feel as though I should have known) was the Internet and the Web were different things. I always naturally associated them with each other, so much so their definitions combined. In a sense, this article was a quick reality check. </p>

<h2> Response to <i>As We May Think</i> </h2> </div>
<p style="background-color: rgb(233, 180, 255);"style= "font-size: 80px;" style=" font: bold"
	;> <i>As We May Think</i> was written by Vannevar Bush in 1945. What makes his piece especially interesting is he speaks about a desired future technology that holds collective memory. He named this the memex, and hoped it would steer technology away from a destrustive nature, as seen in the war, and towards an informative and understanding nature. Bush’s memex essentially described the Internet and Web. I find the especially interesting because while the Web has certainly improved understanding in some regard, it does not lack a destructive nature. The Web allows for misinformation that can allow for a different type of destruction. In that sense the Web simultaneously helps and hurts understanding. Especially after reading <i>Long Live the Web</i> , the Web leaves many things at stake, which can ultimately be incredibly destructive. While his prediction of the memex was incredibly fascinating, Bush never predicted just how dangerous information, or at least twisted information, can be. </p>
