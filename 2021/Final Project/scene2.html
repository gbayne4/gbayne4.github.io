<h1 class="normtext" id = "text0"> Oh? Detective! Thank god you're here, we could really use your help on this case<p> Thank you for picking up the phone (that couldve been bad lol)</p></h1>
<h1 class="normtext" id = "text1"> Mr Boddy (Boddy not Bobby - weird, I know) Was murdered last night (oh no) ... <p> the body was left here, but the murder took place in his mansion. </p></h1>
<h1 class="normtext" id = "text2">His body is covered in burn marks, and has signs of stranglation, however the cause of  <p> death has not been confirmed.</p></h1>
<h1 class="normtext" id = "text3">So far we haven't been able to identify the murderer, weapon, or even room.  <p>  And questioning is almost impossible, with these rich people and their lawyers, smh </p></h1>
<h1 class="normtext" id = "text4"> There were six people at the mansion the night he was murdered. <p>Colonel Mustard, Miss Scarlett, Mr. Green, Mrs. Peacock, Professor Plum, and Mrs. White</p> </h1>
<h1 class="mustardtext" id = "text5">Colonel Mustard (according to wikipedia) is a rich puffy, pompous, dense blowhard of a military man.<p> Also a misogynist. Met Mr. Boddy in school.</p></h1>
<h1 class="scarlettext" id = "text6">Miss Scarlet is a young singer / actress, she is not as well off as the rest of her companions,<p> but is slowly making her debut. Mr. Boddy introduced her to the group.</p></h1>
<h1 class="greentext" id = "text7">Mr. Green is a pastor and a hypocrite (classic). May or may not take advantage of the poor <p>(its his job as a rich guy). Met Mr. Boddy while doing "business"</p></h1>
<h1 class="peacocktext" id = "text8">Mrs. Peacock is a ~material girl~ Born rich and stayed rich. Had a husband but he passed. <p>She met Mr. Boddy through her late husband.</p></h1>
<h1 class="plumtext" id = "text9">Professor Plum is a bit of a nervy guy. Really smart tho. He was very close to Mr. Boddy and is probably the most notably upset by his death.</h1>
<h1 class="whitetext" id = "text10">Mrs. White was Mr. Boddy's maid and nanny when he was young. Very stoic with a classic RBF.<p> Also a bit creepy ngl. But apparantly cared deeply for Mr. Boddy.</p></h1>
<h1 class="normtext" id = "text11">We don't really know what to do bc we're police and basically useless lol, <p>so you got to hang out in the mansion with potential murder suspects and determine the murderer</p></h1>
<h1 class="normtext" id = "text12"> If you don't you'll be a failure and we'll blame this entire situation on you, haha so do your best!!</h1>
